# Cakifo

> Cakifo is a free WordPress theme built with from the rock-solid [Hybrid Core theme framework](http://themehybrid.com/hybrid-core "Hybrid Core") by Justin Tadlock, so it provides a great starting point with many useful features..

This theme is a parent theme. What this means is that to customize it, you should be creating a child theme. Is it a theme framework? Some people might call it that. All you need to know is that it's a solid, yet flexible, starting point for any blog.

* Requires at least WordPress 3.1
* Tested up to 3.2
